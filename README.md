# My Setup

## Terminal

Currently using ghostty for its simple terminal multiplexing, simple config setup, speed, and promise to stay as good as possible at everything it does while still feeling native in the future.

## Editors

I use a custom neovim config influenced by ThePrimeagen, kickstart.nvim, and lazyvim.

I'm loosely following the development of helix. I don't know that it'll ever pass my love for neovim, but I do like the ethos of what they're trying to do. Specifically the highlight then action approach, and also trying to have a fully functional core set of features without plugin management nightmares.

## CLI tools

### lazygit

lazygit is my goto within nvim now, so I'm trying to use it on the CLI as well so my git flow is the same no matter where I'm performing git actions from. 

### starship

Rust powered prompt. I'm not doing too much with this one yet, but by default it makes the prompt look much cleaner to me while providing the info I need at a quick glance.

### Yazi

I'm using yazi for a CLI based file explorer. It feels so much like Snacks.explorer from Folke that I'm already used to, but even snappier. This is a new one for me, but absolutely loving it so far.
